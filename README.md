# vehicle-detection-and-result-visualization
This model is to detect the vehicle and print the result in a heatmap.
The test model is bascially Faster-RCNN model, mostly trained by (big thanks to) Chenge.
The whole project contains three different part: Fetching data, Processing the image by Faster RCNN model, Visualizing the result in the heatmap.

Instalization: This faster rcnn model repository is based on @endernewton tf-faster-rcnn model. The installation is https://github.com/endernewton/tf-faster-rcnn#installation.
Since this repository is used for windows system, other os has not been test before. Please make sure the prerequisites are well done before.
